INTERACTING WITH GIT AND GITHUB
It was solely based on working with git inorder to have better understanding of it.
It is an important tool for software engineers and I'm being trained to be that by the ALX organisation.
Right now no coding has been done but it is loading.Hope to write the best possible codes.
